# TexFlow Development Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for a lightweight macOS LaTeX editor with real-time preview, advanced syntax highlighting, and intelligent autocomplete features.

## Technology Stack Decision

### Recommended Editor Library: Monaco Editor
**Winner: Monaco Editor** - Based on research and requirements analysis

#### Why Monaco Editor?
1. **Proven LaTeX Capability**: Powers VS Code, which has excellent LaTeX support via extensions
2. **Advanced Autocomplete**: Sophisticated IntelliSense system with customizable providers
3. **Language Service Architecture**: Robust framework for custom language implementations
4. **Performance**: Optimized for large files and real-time editing
5. **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features and keyboard navigation
6. **Active Development**: Maintained by Microsoft with regular updates

#### Alternative Considered:
- **CodeMirror 6**: Modern and lightweight, but limited LaTeX ecosystem
- **Ace Editor**: Has built-in LaTeX mode, but less sophisticated autocomplete
- **Custom Solution**: Too much development overhead for the benefits

### Complete Tech Stack

#### Frontend Framework
- **Electron 28+**: Cross-platform desktop application framework
- **React 18**: UI component library with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript 5**: Type-safe development with strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

#### Editor & LaTeX Processing
- **Monaco Editor**: Primary code editor with custom LaTeX language service
- **KaTeX 0.16+**: Fast LaTeX math rendering (primary)
- **MathJax 3**: Fallback for advanced LaTeX features
- **Custom LaTeX Parser**: For syntax validation and autocomplete

#### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **Electron Builder**: Application packaging and distribution

- [ ] Implement scroll synchronization between editor and preview
- [ ] Add export functionality (copy as image, save as PDF)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Enhanced user experience and productivity features

#### Week 7: Autocomplete Enhancement
- [ ] Expand LaTeX command database with descriptions
- [ ] Implement context-aware autocomplete suggestions
- [ ] Add LaTeX symbol picker/palette
- [ ] Create custom macro and command support
- [ ] Implement intelligent bracket and environment completion

#### Week 8: User Experience
- [ ] Implement comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add clipboard functionality for LaTeX code
- [ ] Create document history and session management
- [ ] Implement find and replace functionality
- [ ] Add window management features (pin to top, always on top)

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal**: Quality assurance and production readiness

#### Week 9: Testing & Bug Fixes
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for editor-preview sync
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for user workflows
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Accessibility testing and improvements

#### Week 10: Final Polish
- [ ] UI/UX refinements based on testing feedback
- [ ] Documentation completion (user guide, developer docs)
- [ ] Application packaging for macOS distribution
- [ ] Code signing and notarization setup
- [ ] Final security audit and performance optimization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Monaco Editor LaTeX Language Service
```typescript
// Custom LaTeX language definition structure
interface LaTeXLanguageService {
  tokenizer: LaTeXTokenizer;
  completionProvider: LaTeXCompletionProvider;
  diagnosticsProvider: LaTeXDiagnosticsProvider;
  hoverProvider: LaTeXHoverProvider;
}
```

### LaTeX Command Database Structure
```typescript
interface LaTeXCommand {
  command: string;
  description: string;
  category: 'math' | 'text' | 'environment' | 'symbol';
  parameters: LaTeXParameter[];
  example: string;
  documentation?: string;
}
```

### Real-time Preview Architecture
```typescript
interface PreviewSystem {
  renderer: KaTeXRenderer | MathJaxRenderer;
  synchronizer: EditorPreviewSync;
  errorHandler: LaTeXErrorHandler;
  performance: RenderingOptimizer;
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Monaco LaTeX Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with basic implementation, iterate incrementally
   - Fallback: Switch to CodeMirror 6 if Monaco proves too complex

2. **Real-time Rendering Performance**
   - Mitigation: Implement debouncing and incremental rendering
   - Fallback: Add manual refresh option for complex documents

3. **LaTeX Feature Coverage**
   - Mitigation: Focus on most common use cases first
   - Fallback: Provide raw LaTeX export for unsupported features

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP feature set
   - Process: Regular feature review and prioritization

2. **Timeline Delays**
   - Mitigation: Weekly progress reviews and adjustment
   - Buffer: Built-in 20% time buffer for unexpected issues

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: < 100ms LaTeX rendering for typical equations
- **Usability**: < 5 minutes for new user to create first equation
- **Reliability**: < 1% crash rate during normal usage
- **Feature Coverage**: Support for 90% of common LaTeX math commands
- **User Satisfaction**: > 4.5/5 rating in user testing

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this development plan
2. Set up development environment following Phase 1 guidelines
3. Begin implementation with weekly progress reviews
4. Establish feedback loops with potential users for early testing
